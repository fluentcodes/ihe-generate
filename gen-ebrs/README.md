# IHE Generated Library
This project deliver simple generated classes from IHE ITI and its dependent ebRS.

The idea is to offer the generated sources for ebRS, which hardly never changed as a mvnrepository dependency. 
The standard is a dead horse emerged in the "golden age of XML" with hardly no further development. 

For beginners the format hardly unreadable and stupidly complex even for the simplest values. 

Anyhow a lot of countries decided to use this format for their health backbone, 
and also the german health ministry. 
So the dead horse will live for a while and if you have a project this dependency could save some build time. 

The schemas are a part from the schema/wsdl in version 3.1.3 from the portal of gematik.
