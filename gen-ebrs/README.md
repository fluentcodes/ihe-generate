# IHE Generated Library
This project deliver simple generated classes ebRS and some wrapper for the generated objects.

The idea is to offer the generated sources for ebRS, which hardly never changed as a mvnrepository dependency. 
The standard is a dead horse emerged in the "golden age of XML" with hardly no further development. 

Since a lot of countries decided to use ebXML with IHE for their health backbone, 
the dead horse will live for a while. 


The schemas used are a part from the schema/wsdl in version 3.1.3 from the portal of gematik.
