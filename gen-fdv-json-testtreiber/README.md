##Generated java classes for fdv testtreiber

Gematik has defined a json interface to automatically test the "Frontend des Versicherten" (fdv) 
as part of the "elektronische Patientenakte" (ePA) which is based on the IHE standards.

You find here the generated sources from testtreiber_fdv.yaml. 
Like other sources you find here the intention is to deliver 
the sources as libraries on mvn central, so you don't need to generate the code within your project. 

The version 1.1.1 is the most actual version which could be found in the link below.
